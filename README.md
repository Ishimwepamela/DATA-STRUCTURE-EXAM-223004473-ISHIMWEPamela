It has two structures, Applicant and RateBracket, to hold applicant information and premium rate brackets, respectively. An abstract base class, QuoteEngine, handles a dynamic array of rate brackets and contains methods for calculating quotes, insertion, and deletion of brackets. Two child classes, BasicEngine and PremiumEngine, override the getQuote method, the latter including a markup on the premium. The driver function creates an applicant object, makes a list of quote engines, sets a couple of rate brackets, and adds them to the engines. It requests quotes based on the applicant's age and releases dynamically allocated memory in the end to prevent leaks.
